= Postmark gem

Ruby gem for sending emails through http://postmarkapp.com HTTP API

== Example

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'postmark'
    require 'tmail'

    Postmark.api_key = "your-api-key"

    message = TMail::Mail.new
    message.from = "leonard@bigbangtheory.com"
    message.to = "Sheldon Cooper, Ph.D. <sheldon@bigbangtheory.com>"
    message.subject = "Hi Sheldon!"
    message.content_type = "text/html"
    message.body = "Hello my friend!"

    p Postmark.send_through_postmark(message).body

== Requirements

The gem relies on TMail for building the message. You will also need postmark account, server and sender signature set up to use it. 
If you plan using it in a rails project, check out the postmark-rails gem, which is meant to integrate with ActionMailer. 

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.  
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
